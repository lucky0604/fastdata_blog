## Definition

In probability theory, a normal (or **Gaussian** or **Gauss** or **Laplace-Gauss**) distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is:
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}
$$

- $\mu$ is the *mean* or *expectation* of the distribution (and also its *median* and *mode*)
- $\sigma$ is its *standard deviation*, the variance of the distribution is $\sigma^2$

A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be **normally distributed**, and is called a **normal deviate**.
