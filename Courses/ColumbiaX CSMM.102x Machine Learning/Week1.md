[TOC]

## Lecture 1 Course Overview and Maximum Likelihood

### Overview

Cover model-based techniques for extracting information from data with an end-task in mind. Such tasks include:

- predicting an unknown "output" given its corresponding "input"
- uncovering information within the data to better understand it
- data-driven recommendation , grouping, classification, ranking, etc.

Divide up the material:

**supervised learning | unsupervised learning**

**probabilistic models | non-probabilistic models**

**modeling approach | optimization techniques**
